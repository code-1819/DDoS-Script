# DDoS Attack Script

This Python script performs a simple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack targeting a specified IP address by flooding it with HTTP GET requests.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `socket`, `threading`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
     https://github.com/code-1819/DDoS-Script.git
    ```

2. Open the `main.py` file and modify the following variables according to your requirements:
   - `target`: The IP address of the target server.
   - `fake_ip`: A fake IP address that will be used to spoof the requests.
   - `port`: The port number on which the target server is running.

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

# Warning

- **Use this script responsibly**: DDoS attacks are illegal and unethical. Only use this script for educational purposes or with explicit permission from the target owner.
- **This script may cause disruption**: Running this script may overload the target server, causing it to become slow or unresponsive. Use it at your own risk.
